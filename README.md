# Welcome to my Quote API!
Follow along or give me tips and best practices about building my first REST API!
This is an on-going project and I'm learning as I go. I'm simultaneously learning and coding what I learned as I build out this API, so that I can progress this API while learning valuable skills along the way! 

I appreciate any feedback about my code, concerns, and questions about my project!

## Goals
- Have a database of inspirational quotes from various people throughout history, for now I will have only about 3-4 for testing purposes
- Allow for the API to receive requests without any errors, have solid latency, have clean and readable code
- Allow for the API to be deployed and have an official site to be called to 
- Have all the elements of CRUD(GET POST PUT DELETE)
- Have the API ACTUALLY working first
- Will add more...

## Nice to Haves
- After API ACTUALLY works
    - Category of quotes such as history, political, and financial which will allow user to choose between what type of quotes they want in terms of inspirational quote

## Purpose of API
The purpose of this API is to expand my knowledge on how to build a REST API. The goal of this API is to have a database of inspirational quotes from different figures of people throughout the world and history. This is for me to learn more about databases and how they interact when the front-end wants to use an endpoint and get the data. 

## Current Status
As of April 27, 2023, I am just building out the API and only have a few quotes just so I have something to display and test out. The main goal right now, is to successfully allow the front-end to make requests to this API and use it for an application to display the quotes in the API database
