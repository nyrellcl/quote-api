# Welcome to my Quote API!

## Purpose of API
The purpose of this API is to expand my knowledge on how to build a REST API. The goal of this API is to have a database of inspirational quotes from different figures of people throughout the world and history. This is for me to learn more about databases and how they interact when the front-end wants to use an endpoint and get the data. 

## Current Status
As of April 27, 2023, I am just building out the API and only have a few quotes just so I have something to display and test out. The main goal right now, is to successfully allow the front-end to make requests to this API and use it for an application to display the quotes in the API database
